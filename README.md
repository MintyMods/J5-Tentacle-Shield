# J5-Tentacle-Shield

  

  
J5-Tentacle-Shield is a [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) Plug in for the [WhiteBox Labs](https://www.whiteboxes.ch/) [Tentacle Shield for Arduino](https://www.whiteboxes.ch/shop/tentacle/) 

This plug in exposes up to four optional circuits from [Atlas Scientific](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/) as Johnny Five devices that can be controlled using JavaScript. These circuits can be mixed and matched in any combination and currently support the following types of sensors which can purchased from the White Box Labs [online shop](https://www.whiteboxes.ch/shop/) or directly from [Atlas Scientific](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/):-

 - Temperature (RTD) 
 - Electric Conductivity (E.C.) 
 - PH 
 - Dissolved Oxygen
 - Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP)
